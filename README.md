# Navier-Stokes-Solver
This is a pressure-based solver and uses finite volume methods. RK3-CN algorithm was used for solving the (a) Lid-driven Cavity and (b) Flow past a Square Cylinder. For reducing the iterations for solving the pressure-poisson relation, a 3-level Multigrid V Cycle was used.
Please read the reports for a better understanding of the algorithm and mathematical formulation of the solver.
